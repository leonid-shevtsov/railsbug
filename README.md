# RailsBug - debug Rails apps from Firebug!

**WARNING** this is prealpha stuff! I'm not going to walk you through it (yet).

**TODO** screenshots

**TODO** advantages

**TODO** extension

## Installation

First, you'll need to set up `rack-bug` from https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/rack-bug. My branch is patched to provide data for this extension.

Then, you install this extension into Firefox and off you go!

## Credit where credit is due

Two things that made this extension much simpler to code:

* `rack-bug`, a Rails debugging toolbar - i used it for the backend as it has a great structure for such a tool.
* eresig's Javascript microtemplating microframework - DOMplate is *such* a mess.
